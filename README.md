# create-react-webpack-proj

Create a React app boiler plate with webpack. This is an enterprise grade boiler plate with a fully configured webpack that includes tailwind, environments, eslint, TypeScript (ts, tsx) and regular JavaScript (js, jsx). It is fully customizable. You can remove, add, or modify existing configuration according to your requirements.

Version 1.1.0 released on 5/30/2025 incorporates latest version of **ESLint** flat config, latest version of **Tailwind**, latest version of **Webpack**, and latest version of **React 19**.

Please report any issue [here](https://github.com/markjovis/react-webpack-template/issues).

## Installation

No installation is needed if you use the npx command (see Usage below). If you prefer to install and run the CLI, install the CLI globally with the following command:

`npm i -g create-react-webpack-proj`

## Usage

From the directory where you want your new app project to be in, run `npx create-react-webpack-proj my-app` where "my-app" is the name of your new application project.

If you installed the CLI, go to the directory where you want your new app project to be in, and run the following command:

`create-react-webpack-proj my-app` where "my-app" is the name of your new application project.

To run the app you just created, from your terminal, go to the "my-app" directory (or the app name you entered with the create command), and type `npm start` .

## NOTICE

Please note that this boiler plate defaults to **TypeScript**. If you do not wish to develop with **TypeScript**, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/markjovis/react-webpack-template#readme) or follow instructions in the **README.md** file of the "my-app" after creating it.
